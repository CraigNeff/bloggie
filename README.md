# ASP.NET Blog Solution

This repository is a personal project designed to help me learn, understand, and apply the principles of modern .NET development. By building this blog solution from scratch, I aim to deepen my understanding of .NET Core (updated to .NET 8) and related technologies.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a scalable ASP.NET Core MVC application while mastering key concepts of .NET development. This blog solution serves as a learning platform for me to experiment with advanced .NET features and best practices.

## Features and Learning Objectives

Here are the key concepts and features I am focusing on as I build out this project:

### Core Concepts
- **.NET Core MVC Development**: Learn, understand, and create MVC websites from scratch using .NET Core 8 and C#.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: Use EF Core in a code-first approach to perform CRUD operations on a SQL Server database.
- **Repository Pattern**: Understand and implement the repository pattern for data access.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Create domain-first models and structure the project accordingly.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: Explore and apply MVC patterns in ASP.NET Core.

### Advanced Features
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement login, registration, and role-based authorization using Microsoft Identity.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Apply dependency injection to manage services effectively in the application.
- **Model Validation**: Add and use ASP.NET Core model validations to enforce business rules.
- **ViewData and TempData**: Pass data from models to views using ViewData and TempData.

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Bootstrap 5 Integration**: Build responsive and user-friendly interfaces using Bootstrap 5.
- **Bootstrap Alerts**: Display notifications and feedback to users.
- **Image Upload**: Enable image uploads to third-party hosting providers using their SDKs.
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: Add a rich text editor with image upload functionality for an enhanced user experience.

### Advanced ASP.NET Core Topics
- Explore and implement advanced topics in ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) as they arise during the project.

## Progress

This project is a work in progress, and I am continually updating it as I learn and apply new concepts. While the primary focus is on learning, the end goal is to have a functional blog application that demonstrates my understanding of the mentioned technologies.
